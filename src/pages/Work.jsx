        I have worked on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in Data Analysis and Full Stack Web Development. My data analysis projects focus on extracting actionable insights from complex datasets, using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and data visualization libraries to solve real-world problems. In parallel, my full stack projects involve designing and building scalable, user-friendly web applications using technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, combined with RESTful APIs and modern UI frameworks.
